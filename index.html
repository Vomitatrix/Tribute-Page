            <ul>
                <li>April 11th, 2154. A legend is born.</li>
                <li>2183, Eden Prime is attacked by Spectre Saren Arterius. Shepard and crew pursue him and stumble upon the conduit with which he ends up interfacing.</li>
                <li>2183 again, Shepard fights a bunch of geth, korgans, humans, turians, and loads more, like the badass he is.</li>
                <li>2183 once again, Shepard leaves one of his companions, Ashley or Kaidan, to die in an epic explosion also killing a bunch of tank-bred krogans.</li>
                <li>2183, yea, there's more. Shepard is granted the rank of Spectre by the council and he takes the job like the absolute badass he is.</li>
                <li>2183 still, a Reaper called Sovereign attacks the Citadel. Everybody unites and Shepard defeats Saren, warns everybody about the Reapers, but they deny they exist. Arseholes.</li>
                <li>2183, I know, a bunch of stuff happened. The SSV Normandy is attacked and destroyed by the collectors. A legend dies.</li>
                <li>2185, Shepard is revived. A legend returns. He's tasked by the Illusive Man to investigate the disappearances of human colonies.</li>
                <li>2185 again, Shepard manages to track down the abductors, the collectors, and goes to their home and blows it up. What a legend.</li>
                <li>2186, the Reapers attack the galaxy, yo! No one believed our man but he was telling the truth all along. Of course, he was. He's Shepard.</li>
                <li>2186, the man himself decides to go on a crusade, killing reapers, and uniting every species in the galaxy, except for the salarians, we don't know what happened to them. He even manages to solve the issue between the quarians and the geth. I know I say it a lot, but, what a legend, seriously.</li>
                <li>2186, Shepard saves the galaxy, whether it's by destroying AIs, controlling the Reapers, or synthesising with them, we don't know. But he did it. Because he is awesome.</li>
            </ul>
